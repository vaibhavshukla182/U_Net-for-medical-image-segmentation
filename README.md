# U_Net for medical image segmentation

In this repo I have implemented the U_Net architecture as proposed in this paper - [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) .
The architecture in the paper is as follows:

I have not implemented the architecture as it is but made some minor changes like adding dropouts etc. to improve my accuracy.
The final architecture I used is as follows:
